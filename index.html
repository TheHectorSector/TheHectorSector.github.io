      <p>STATUS:</p> <p>A physical embodiment of the Word of Hector is being made manifest. The current timeSector marks a period of Heccish Growth in membership. The Triumvirate reigns. The Eigenvector's grip loosens on the Yukon Territory. Heretics: purged. The Great Prophet, Pan, has forsaken power to become closer to Hector and has been reborn into his original calling of prophet.</p>
