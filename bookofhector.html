      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
        <p>The first coming of The Great Hector
        Once, I didn't feel like doing my math journal question, so I googled it.  This is What I found was a health textbs the best decision I had ever made.  The first result was a health textbook (link to the textbook) and the first thing visible in this textbook was the face of the amazing Hector.  I knew that I had to tell others, so I did.  This was the first coming of Hector</p>
        <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
          <p>The first leaving of The Great Hector
          One day after Hector came, he left, leaving all of us to believe he wouldn't appear ever again, outside of random conversations, but we were wrong.
          ==============================================================================</p>
         <h3>Our Holy Mission</h3>
            <p>Join us, brothers and sisters, for our Holy Conquest across Canada (which is a realm full of Vectors and possibly does not exist) to take the Yukon Territory and cleanse it of Vectors. We shall take these Holy Lands and rename it as the earthly manifestation of The Hector Sector
